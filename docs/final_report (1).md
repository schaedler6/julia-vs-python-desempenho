# 📊 Final Report – Julia vs Python Performance

## 📁 Project Path
`J:\SCHAEDLER\Senac Gabriel 2025\Desempenho Julia Vs Python`

## 🎯 Objective
Compare the performance between Julia and Python in computational tasks involving:
- Matrix multiplication
- Prime number generation
- Monte Carlo simulation for estimating π

## 🧪 Tests Summary

| Test                          | Julia Time (s) | Python Time (s) | Julia RAM (MB) | Python RAM (MB) |
|-------------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Matrix Multiplication         | 1.02           | 2.10             | 231.57         | 314.22          |
| Prime Number Generation       | 0.0038         | 0.05             | 0.74           | 9.45            |
| Monte Carlo Simulation (π)    | 0.0083         | 0.15             | 0.03           | 11.03           |

## 📈 Analysis
Julia consistently outperformed Python across all three tests. The differences were especially noticeable in memory efficiency and execution speed for simple iterative tasks such as the Monte Carlo simulation and prime number generation.

## ✅ Conclusion
Julia is the ideal choice for performance-critical and memory-sensitive mathematical tasks. Python remains valuable for its ecosystem and ease of use, but in computational benchmarks, Julia proves to be more efficient and scalable.
